# Simple React Starter Kit
A simple react starter kit based on Webpack


#Preparation

First you need to have Node.js installed. This will install npm, the Node Package Manager, which will be used to download components.

Simply run 'npm install' to install the dependent modules.


#Writing your app

White your cpde in the ./src/app.jsx. A basic structure is given.


#Running your app

Run 'npm run dev' to run webpack in developer mode or run 'npm run build' to run webpack in production mode.

Run 'npm start server' to start the server. Your app will be served from the address 'localhost:8081' and you can access your app by entering that address into your browser.


#Notes
You can modify the global styles in the './public/style.css' file. But you can define separate css files for components and import them within the component.
